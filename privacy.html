          We will provide your information to third party companies to perform
          services on our behalf, including payment processing, data analysis,
          e-mail delivery, hosting services, customer service and to assist us
          in our marketing efforts. We direct all such third party service
          providers to maintain the confidentiality of the information disclosed
          to them and to not use your information for any purpose other than to
          provide services on New Hill Strategic Management Ltd.'s behalf.
        </p>
        <h3>Friends and Other New Hill Strategic Management Ltd. Users</h3>
        <p>
          In some New Hill Strategic Management Ltd. applications other users
          will be able to see your application name or pseudonym and a
          application profile. Your application profile may include your profile
          photo, which in certain cases can reveal your User ID number. Access
          to this information may allow others to view the public information
          associated with your related SNS account.
        </p>
        <h3>Advertising of Third-Party Products and Services</h3>
        <p>
          We do not actively share personal information with third party
          advertisers for their direct marketing purposes unless you give us
          your consent. If we wish to share in this fashion, we will ask for
          your consent. Advertisers, however, may obtain public information
          about you from your profile or other public sources. We may use and
          share with third parties certain technical information (including IP
          addresses) or aggregated information to show general demographic and
          preference information among New Hill Strategic Management Ltd. users.
          We may also allow advertisers to collect technical or aggregated
          information, which they may share with us, with tracking technologies
          like cookies and web beacons. The information collected may be used to
          offer you targeted ad-selection and delivery in order to personalize
          your user experience by ensuring that advertisements for products and
          services you see will appeal to you, a practice known as behavioral
          advertising, and to undertake web analytics (i.e. to analyze traffic
          and other end user activity to improve your experience). To learn more
          about behavioral advertising or to opt-out of this type of advertising
          for participating ad networks, you can visit the Network Advertising
          Initiative website. Our collection, use, and disclosure of anonymous
          and aggregated information are not subject to any of the restrictions
          in this Privacy Policy.
        </p>
        <h3>Offer Walls</h3>
        <p>
          New Hill Strategic Management Ltd. applications or their purchase
          pages may disuse an "offer wall" that is hosted by an offer wall
          provider. The offer wall allows third party advertisers to provide
          virtual currency to users in exchange for interacting with an
          advertisement or for completing a marketing offer that may include
          signing up for an account with one of those advertisers. These are not
          offers made by New Hill Strategic Management Ltd.. These offers may be
          displayed to you based on certain technical information, such as your
          geographic area or anonymous demographic information. After clicking
          on one of these advertisements, you will no longer be on a site hosted
          by New Hill Strategic Management Ltd. or partnering SNS. To properly
          credit user accounts and to prevent fraud, a unique identifier, in
          some cases your user ID number, will be shared with the offer wall
          provider. This identifier is used to ensure proper crediting of your
          account, prevent fraud or duplicate offers and to resolve any customer
          service inquiries that may arise. Once you complete an offer, you will
          then return to a New Hill Strategic Management Ltd. website or
          application.
        </p>
        <h3>Safety, Security and Compliance with Law</h3>
        <p>
          Your information, and the contents of your private online
          communications, may be accessed and disclosed (i) in response to legal
          process (for example, a court order, search warrant or subpoena); (ii)
          when we have a good faith belief that we are required to disclose the
          information in response to legal process; (iii) in other circumstances
          in which New Hill Strategic Management Ltd. believes the New Hill
          Strategic Management Ltd. applications or web sites are being used in
          the commission of a crime (including exchanging information with other
          companies and organizations for the purposes of fraud protection and
          credit risk reduction); (iv) when we have a good faith belief that
          there is an emergency that poses a threat to the safety of you or
          another person; and (v) when necessary either to protect the rights or
          property of New Hill Strategic Management Ltd. including to enforce
          our Terms of Use, or for us to render the service you have requested.
        </p>
        <h3>Sale or Merger</h3>
        <p>
          In the event that New Hill Strategic Management Ltd. undergoes a
          business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company,
          or sale of all or a portion of its assets, we may transfer all of your
          information, including personal information, to the successor
          organization in such transition. If material changes to New Hill
          Strategic Management Ltd.'s privacy practices will occur as a result
          of the business transition, we will notify you and other users (in the
          manner described in Section 12) of the business transition prior to
          transferring your personal information.

          Information We Receive from Third-Party SNS Where You use a New Hill
          Strategic Management Ltd. Application
        </h3>
        <p>
          If you use our applications at a third-party SNS, New Hill Strategic
          Management Ltd. will be able to access and store profile and other
          information about you as described above. The categories of
          information you share with us will depend, in part, on the privacy
          settings you have established at the SNS where you access the
          application. Many SNS allow you to control how you share information
          with third-party applications and websites, such as New Hill Strategic
          Management Ltd. applications, through your privacy settings on each
          SNS. New Hill Strategic Management Ltd. does not control what privacy
          settings those sites make available to their users, so we refer you to
          the privacy policies that are posted on those sites to learn what
          options they make available to their users. New Hill Strategic
          Management Ltd. does not offer an "opt out" option for specific fields

          application(s).

        <h3>Opting out of Promotional Communications</h3>
        <p>
          You can choose to opt out of receiving additional promotional e-mails
          from New Hill Strategic Management Ltd. by clicking on the
          "unsubscribe" link in any such e-mail. Please note that once we
          receive your request, it may take an additional period of time for
          your opt-out to become effective. Your unsubscribe or e-mail
          preference change will be processed promptly, and in no event longer
          than 10 business days. You can opt out of receiving SMS messages by
          texting STOP to the number we send from for that particular SMS
          program. In some cases a preference management page will also be
          available under the "Help" menu of the application that is offering
          the SMS program. When you install our apps on your mobile device you
          can choose to receive push notifications. These notifications can be
          turned off by modifying your mobile device settings for notifications.
          Note that if you opt-out of our Promotional Communications, we may
          still e-mail or communicate with you from time to time if we need to
          provide you with information or if we need to request information from
          you with respect to a transaction initiated by you or for other

        </h2>
        <p>
          As part of our international operations, we may transfer data to our
          Affiliates from time to time for our legitimate business purposes. For
          example, New Hill Strategic Management Ltd. provides certain services
          to its Affiliates (which shall mean subsidiaries, parent companies,
          joint ventures and other corporate entities under common ownership).
          New Hill Strategic Management Ltd. stores information about site
          visitors and users on servers located in the United States, and New
          Hill Strategic Management Ltd. may also store such information on
          servers and equipment in other countries. Personal data collected
          within Switzerland and the European Economic Area (“EEA”) may be
          transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside of Switzerland
          and the European Economic Area (“EEA”). The data we hold may also be
          processed by employees operating outside of Switzerland and the EEA
          who work for us or one of our Affiliates or for one of our vendors.
          Such staff may be engaged in, among other things, (i) the processing
          of transactions and your payment details and (ii) the provision of
          support services. By submitting your personal data or using New Hill
          Strategic Management Ltd. applications, you agree to this transfer,
          storing or processing. New Hill Strategic Management Ltd. complies
          with the Safe Harbor framework as set forth by the Department of
          Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of online user
          data from the European Union and Switzerland. We will take all steps
          reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and
          in accordance with this privacy policy.

          Our websites and applications may contain advertisements from
          companies other than New Hill Strategic Management Ltd. with their own
          websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the

      <div class="chapter-11 chapter">
        <h2>11. Security of Your Information</h2>
        <p>
          New Hill Strategic Management Ltd. implements reasonable security
          measures to protect the security of your information both online and
          offline, and we are committed to the protection of customer
          information. For user accounts registered directly with New Hill
          Strategic Management Ltd. profile information is protected by the
          password each member uses to access their online account. It is
          important that you protect and maintain the security of your account
          and that you immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your
          account. If you forget the password to your New Hill Strategic
          Management Ltd. account, the website allows you to request that
          instructions be sent to you that explain how to reset your password.
          When you sign into your account or enter payment information (such as
          a credit card number when purchasing virtual currency), we encrypt the
          transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology
          ("SSL"). While we take reasonable precautions against possible
          security breaches of our websites and our customer databases and
          records, no website or Internet transmission is completely secure, and
          we cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss, or
          other breaches will never occur. We urge you to take steps to keep
          your personal information safe (including your account password), and
          to log out of your account after use. If your SNS account is hacked,
          this may lead to unauthorized use of your New Hill Strategic
          Management Ltd. applications, so be careful to keep your account
          information secure. If you have questions about the security of our
          websites, please contact us at privacy@new-hill.co.uk. Unfortunately,
          the transmission of information over the Internet is not completely
          secure. Although we strive to protect your personal data, we cannot
          guarantee the security of your data while it is being transmitted to
          our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received
          your information, we have procedures and security features in place to
          try to prevent unauthorized access.

          We do not share personal information with third parties for their

          information with a third party for its marketing purposes, we will
          only share information in connection with that specific promotion, as
          we do not share information with any third party (other than our
          service providers) on a continual basis. To prevent disclosure of your
          personal information for use in direct marketing by a third party, do
          not opt in to such use when you provide personal information on one of
          our sites.
